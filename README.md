# Data-Driven Analysis of User' Exercise Patterns
## Overview
"Optimizing Performance" is a comprehensive data analysis project that delves into the exercise routines of our user, with a focus on optimizing athletic performance. Utilizing a blend of Python's powerful libraries and detailed visualizations, this project explores patterns in Chris Brooks' exercise data, offering insights and recommendations for performance enhancement.

## Project Description
The project analyzes user's exercise data collected during the summer of 2019. This data, derived from various devices and published on Strava, includes vital metrics like heart rate, speed, and cadence. The analysis targets two primary activities: running and cycling.

Using Python 3.8.5 and libraries such as pandas, numpy, Plotly, and matplotlib, the project implements extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis. The analysis includes various visualization techniques like scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and parallel coordinates plots, each chosen for its effectiveness in revealing different aspects of the exercise data.

## Key components of the project:

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Preparing the raw data for analysis.
## Exploratory Data Analysis: 
Visualizing and interpreting the data to uncover trends and patterns.
## Performance Insights: 
Offering recommendations based on the analysis to enhance Chris Brooks' training effectiveness.
## Installation
Before running the analysis, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. plotly
   
You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly

## Data Privacy
Please note that the dataset used in this project is not publicly available due to privacy concerns. The analysis is documented in a PDF report, which is available in this repository.
